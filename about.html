            information advocacy
        </div>
        <div class="para">Welcome to FoodSecInfo, an initiative that seeks to tackle food insecurity among
            school-aged children in Hamilton, Ontario. Our goal is to improve the overall health and wellbeing of
            students by connecting them and their families with appropriate community resources and
            organizations specialized in addressing food access challenges.
        </div>
        <div class="para">Food insecurity is a complex issue that demands a thoughtful, comprehensive approach.
            Recognizing this need, we conducted extensive interviews and consultations with Tina Moffat, Steve Buist,
            and Nancy Phelan &ndash; experts who are passionate about combating food insecurity. These efforts have
            shaped our understanding of the problem and our focus on addressing it by partnering with local food
            security organizations.

        <div class="min">Information Advocacy
        </div>
        <div class="para">FoodSecInfo's primary advocacy tool this website which hosts essential information about various food security organizations operating within Hamilton. We
            provide crucial details such as the name, specialization (e.g., emergency food supply, hot meals, cooking
            classes, school lunches), descriptions of services provided, and online links to these organizations.
        </div>
        <div class="para">Also on this site, we offer an interactive quiz designed to match
            users with relevant food security services based on sociodemographic information, needs, and preferences of
            the participants. See the "quiz" page.
        </div>
        <div class="para">To fine-tune our assistance further &ndash; while respecting cultural practices &ndash; we
            also provide options for families having Halal or Kosher dietary restrictions. Specialized resources are
            available for women and newcomer mothers, addressing unique situations and concerns.
        </div>
        <div class="min">An Ongoing Project
        </div>
        <div class="para">Currently, our website serves as a proof of concept &ndash; providing innovative solutions by
            collating resourceful organizations at your fingertips. However, we continuously strive to expand its scope
            by adding more organizations, covering broader jurisdictions of Hamilton, and continually refining the
            questionnaire to establish a stronger support network for those in need.
        </div>
        <div class="para">At FoodSecInfo, we pride ourselves on employing information advocacy as an effective means of
            reducing food insecurity among Hamilton's school-aged children. By collecting relevant information on
            existing services and sharing this knowledge in a centralized resource accessible by all who can benefit
            from it, we endeavor to improve food accessibility and eliminate hunger for students across our region.
