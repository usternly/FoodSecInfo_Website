        <div class="para">To further assist families in finding the right resources tailored to their needs, our website also includes an interactive quiz that gathers relevant sociodemographic data as well as specific dietary preferences or restrictions. Based on this information, we match users with suitable organizations best equipped to provide assistance. We are continuously expanding our database and refining our quiz algorithm to ensure accuracy and coverage across more jurisdictions within Hamilton. Our mission is not only focused on connecting families with existing services but also fostering a supportive community-oriented environment where everyone can thrive.
